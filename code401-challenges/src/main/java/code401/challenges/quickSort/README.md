# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This folder contains a java class that has a method that implements quick sort.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Complete a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort, based on the pseudo code provided.

Research and prepare a lecture on the Quick Sort Algorithm suitable for delivery to 301 level student.
Your lecture notes should be the only material an instructor should need to conduct a high quality
lecture on the subject.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took a Divide and Conquer algorithmn
BIG 0
Time = O(nlog(n))
Space = O(log(n))

## Solution
