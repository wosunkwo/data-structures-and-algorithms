# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This direcotry contains a java file that does a merge sort. The function gets an unsorted array as input an sorts it.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Complete a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort, based on the pseudo code provided.

Research and prepare a lecture on the Merge Sort Algorithm suitable for delivery to 301 level student. Your lecture notes should be the only material an instructor should need to conduct a high quality lecture on the subject.



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took an efficient approach
The big O for Time for this approach is O(nlog(n)).
Space is O(1).
