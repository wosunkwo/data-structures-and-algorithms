# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This folder conatains a fizzbuzz class that has on method. FizzBuzz() which goes throught the binary tree and replaces any number divisible by
3 to "fizz", any number divisible by 5 to "buzz" and any number divisible by 3 and 5 to "fizzbuzz"

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
Return the tree with its new values.
