# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This folder contains a class that implements one method that does an insertion sort on an array and returns the new sorted array

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Complete a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort, based on the pseudo code provided

Research and prepare a lecture on the Insertion Sort Algorithm suitable for delivery to 301 level student. Your lecture notes should be the only material an instructor should need to conduct a high quality lecture on the subject.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used an iterative apporach and looped through the array
Big(0) Time = 0(n2) where n is the size of the array
Big(0) Space = 0(1)
