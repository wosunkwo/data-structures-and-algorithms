Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights?
If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Feature tasks:

Feature Tasks
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible
with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency
- The Big 0 for this approach is: Time O(n * m). Where n is the sizw of the array and m is the individual
number of neighbours of the nodes
- The Big 0 for this approach is: Space O(1).
