# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This folder contains a class that has a method that takes in a lenghty string mostly like a sentence and
it converts that sentence to an array of words then it adds them to hashmap and while adding any new string
it checks if that string already exits in the hashmap and if it does, it returns that string

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Find the first repeated word in a book.
Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, 
return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I Utilized the Single-responsibility principle: any methods I wrote were clean, reusable, abstract
component parts to the whole challenge.
Big 0
Time - 0(n) where n is the number of words in the sentence
Space - 0(n) where n is the number of words in the sentence
