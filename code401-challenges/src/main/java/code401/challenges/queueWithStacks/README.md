# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This folder contains a java class that implements a queue logic using 2 stack objects as its instance variables. The class performs two operations. Enqueue and Dequeue

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did ydou take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took a single responsibility approach, where each of my methods served only one purpose

## Solution
