# Common values in 2 binary trees.
Implement a function to find the common values in 2 binary trees.


## Challenge

> Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.

> Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
> O(n) , constant 

## API
> tree_intersection : Which accepts the two binary search tree
