# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This folder contains a java file that validates brackets "(", ")", "{", "}", "[", and "]". It takes in a string and it checks wheather that string is balanced and returns true if it is or false if it isnt


## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took a single responsibility approach.
Big 0 Space: 0(1)
Big 0 Time: 0(n) where n represents the size of the string
