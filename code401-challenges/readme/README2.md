# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This code challenge deals with array manipulation. In the main method of the ArrayShift class I am calling one function. The function takes in two parameters, an array and a value. It places the value in the middle of the array and returns the new array

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
This Challenge requires the program to add an element to the middle of an array and print out the new array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used a brute force method for the function, because i couldn't think of a way to do it with divide and conquer or reduce and conquer. The Big 0 time complexity is 0(m) where m is the size of the new array after adding an element in the middle.
